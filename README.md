Worked on setting up the Wikitongues wordpress files and successfully set it up, but faced an issue with upstreaming to the Wikitongues repo. Contacted Daniel for help with the upstreaming issue and provided with resources. 
10	| 10/22/23	| Working on fixing the issue with upstreaming. Followed resources and faced most likely an access error when attempting to updtream. Getting ready to write up slides about the tasks assigned and working on a plan on how to go about it. (10/24) Got the upstreaming issue fixed by getting access rights to the wikitongues repo. Started working on the carousel scroll issue on the website main page. (10/27) We had a meeting with Daniel and spoke about the next steps. Nafisa had rewritten the entire custom.js even though she couldn't see the how everyhting changed. The scroll function stopped working as a result. Sabina had gotten the scrollbar to work and be dynamically changed. Daniel had given another assignment which is more on data cleaning and set up a meeting for Nafisa to meet Shahani, if Nafisa says no, Sabina will be connected to see if she wanted to do the work.
11	| 10/29/23 | 	Nafisa had a meeting with Shahani regarding the data mining project and how would it go. She is thinking about how she would approach it before she agrees to the project. We had the Demo 2 meeting with AJ. He discussed on next steps for the internship itself as it is nearing the end of the semester. Sabina made a pull-request completing the jQuery to vanilla js conversion and the fix to make the carouselScroll() function dynamic. She had the carouselScroll() function fixed and was waiting for Nafisa to fix unrelated history issues with the repository and be able to push her changes before she proceeded. Sabina updated Daniel about the task being done and to look over the pull-request and confirm for merge. Daniel replied saying he had to travel and would get back to it. The Friday weekly check-in was pushed back to next week Tuesday because Daniel was traveling. Sabina was told to research and familiarize herself with PHP syntax and in-line PHP in preperation for the next project. The next project hasn't been discussed yet. Nafisa is researching about data mining to see if she can take up the new task she was introduced to by Shahani. 
12	| 11/5/23	| Nafisa and Sabina met with Daniel on Tuesday. Nafisa updated with that she had contacted Shahani and her agreement with the data project. She has asked Daniel for further way to contact Shahani. Daniel moved on with Sabina and has discussed her next task. He had gone over the backend and how wordpress works, including where the necessary files are and how Sabina will be moving forward with her work. Sabina's new task is to make the homepage banner to be more dynamic in the fact that the image can change to another image instead of being static. 
13	| 11/12/23	| Sabina is waiting on the team to test the PR for approval and was assigned a new task to make the homepage banner dynamic/variable(Tuesday, 11/7). This would make the banner change for every instance that the website is opened, picking an image from the array of images provided by the admin on the WordPress CMS. Worked with Daniel to get a user setup to access the WordPress site CMS(Wednesday, 11/8).Did research on the different data options provided by the ACF WordPress extension that the website uses to make custom pages(Thursday, 11/9). Adjusted the CMS to let admin select multiple images for the banenr instead of just one image. Made changes to the banner--main.php file to accomodate the array passed in by the gallery from the CMS(11/10). Faced some issues with testing the code as there were issues saving the added images in the CMS. Contacted Daniel to troubleshoot this.
